In this program I will implement a versin of the  game space invaders
for Game Development class. In this game there will be a main ship where 
it will be able to shoot bullets to other smaller space ships.

This project will be done in python and 
it will be ran through the terminal/command prompt.

For this program to run you will have to have python installed
in your computer. However, if you use ubuntu python comes 
already installed.

How to run it:
First go to your folder where search.py is in.
For example: cd /Game-Dev/Project$ 
once you are there you simply type:
python search.py

Brainstorm:

Right off the bat I know that we are going to need a few classes
Possible classes
	-main ship or mother ship
	-small ships/enemies
	-maybe a few bigger enemies (possible)
	-bullets might only be a function or maybe a whole class

class MotherShip():
	def bullets(): #not sure if this will work like this might need to make this a class.
